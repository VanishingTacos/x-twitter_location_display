#### Step-by-Step Installation:

1. **Download the Extension**
   - Click the green "Code" button at the top of this page
   - Select "Download ZIP"
   - Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer (e.g., `C:\Extensions\x-location-display` or `~/Extensions/x-location-display`)

2. **Open Chrome Extensions Page**
   - Open Google Chrome
   - Type `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar and press Enter
   - OR click the three-dot menu → More Tools → Extensions

3. **Enable Developer Mode**
   - Look for the "Developer mode" toggle in the top-right corner
   - Click it to turn it ON (it should turn blue)

4. **Load the Extension**
   - Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears after enabling Developer mode
   - Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension files
   - Select the folder and click "Select Folder" or "Open"

5. **Verify Installation**
   - You should see "X Location Display" appear in your extensions list
   - Make sure the toggle is ON (blue)
   - You should see the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar

6. **Test the Extension**
   - Go to [X.com/Twitter](https://x.com)
   - Click the extension icon
   - Follow [@Rayomand14](https://x.com/Rayomand14) to unlock the extension
   - Wait 6 seconds, then click "Activate Extension"
   - Browse your timeline - location badges will appear next to usernames!

#### Troubleshooting Local Installation

**Extension not loading?**
- Make sure you selected the correct folder (the one containing `manifest.json`)
- Check that all files are present (manifest.json, content.js, background.js, etc.)

**Not seeing location badges?**
- Make sure you completed the follow + activation steps in the popup
- Try refreshing the X.com page
- Check the browser console (F12) for any errors

**Extension disappeared after Chrome restart?**
- This is normal for unpacked extensions
- Go back to `chrome://extensions/` and make sure it's still enabled
- You may need to reload it by clicking the refresh icon

## How It Works

1. **Install** the extension using one of the methods above
2. **Activate** by following [@Rayomand14](https://x.com/Rayomand14) (supports development!)
3. **Browse** X/Twitter normally - location badges appear automatically next to usernames

The extension intercepts X's GraphQL API responses and displays publicly available location data from user profiles without requiring additional API calls.

## Privacy

- ✅ All location data is cached locally in your browser
- ✅ No data is sent to external servers
- ✅ No tracking or analytics
- ✅ Open source and auditable

## Permissions

- **storage**: Cache location data locally for better performance
- **host_permissions (x.com, twitter.com)**: Access X's API to retrieve location information

## Technical Details

**Built with:**

- Vanilla JavaScript (no dependencies)
- Chrome Extension APIs

**Architecture:**
- Content script runs in MAIN world to intercept fetch requests
